You can rely on [long_term.md](mdc:debt-purchasing-frontend/.cursor/memory_bank/long_term.md) and all memory inside folder `.cursor/memory_bank/` to implements tasks. 

Because there it will contain everything about the project that has been done. 

Helps reduce the context window for reading the entire code. 

You should rely on this memory to continue developing or maintaining features.
