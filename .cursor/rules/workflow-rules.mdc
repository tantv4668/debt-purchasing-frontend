1. Only when user starts a new conversation:
- Read [long_term.md](mdc:debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/.cursor/memory_bank/long_term.md) file to get the context of the project.
- Generate a workflow name (under 10 words, snake case).
- Then, create file `.cursor/memory_bank/wf_{workflow_name}.md`. The content must have the following sections: - Current tasks from user prompt.
 + Plan (simple): your plan & thoughts to solve task(s).
 + Steps: break your plan into small steps.
 + Things done
 + Things not done yet
 + In a cycle of current conversation:

2. If continuing with an existing conversation:
- Read current `.cursor/memory_bank/wf_{workflow_name}.md` file. Don't be lazy, don't omit any content.
- Update plan and steps if needed, based on the current state.
- After you finish a task, update `Things done` and `Things not done yet` to track your work.
- Summary all lastest flow + logic + feature to [long_term.md](mdc:debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/debt-purchasing-frontend/.cursor/memory_bank/long_term.md) (as concise as possible but still followable and easy to understand in general for continued development and maintenance)

3. You can also find other related memories in the `.cursor/memory_bank` folder to have more context for updating or developing more features. In the folders `.cursor/memory_bank` there can also be many other memories. You can rely on either the file name or the content to get the necessary and complete information to perform the job.
